üõ°Ô∏è ITI Graduation Project: Real-Time Fraud Detection

üõ°Ô∏è Real-Time Fraud Detection System

This repository contains the implementation of a Real-Time Fraud Detection System, designed to detect anomalies and fraudulent activities by leveraging a modern, scalable data engineering and analytics pipeline.
üìä System Architecture
Overview

The system follows an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline, powered by Apache Airflow, with seamless integration of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services for real-time data processing and analytics.
Key Components

    Data Source
        The initial data ingestion begins from various sources such as transactional databases or log systems.

    Extraction
        Kafka: Captures and streams raw data for processing.
        Google Pub/Sub: Manages and distributes messages to downstream services in real time.

    Transformation
        Google Dataflow: Handles data transformations and enrichments, preparing data for storage and analysis.

    Loading
        Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Serves as a staging area for processed data, enabling batch and real-time transformations.

    Processing
        Google Dataproc:
            Facilitates distributed data processing using Apache Spark for advanced analytics.
            Implements machine learning workflows for fraud detection.

    Analytics & Visualization
        Google BigQuery:
            Acts as a data warehouse for running SQL-based analytics on transformed datasets.
        Power BI:
            Provides interactive dashboards and visualizations for stakeholders to monitor fraud detection insights.

    Monitoring
        Google Cloud Monitoring: Tracks system performance, alerting on anomalies or failures in the pipeline.

üéØ Key Features

    Real-Time Data Processing:
    Ensures immediate detection of fraudulent activities by leveraging streaming tools like Kafka and Pub/Sub.

    Scalable Analytics:
    Combines the power of Spark on Dataproc and BigQuery for handling massive datasets.

    Machine Learning Integration:
    Implements fraud detection models that classify and flag suspicious activities.

    End-to-End Orchestration:
    Automated workflows using Apache Airflow for seamless ELT processes.

    Actionable Insights:
    Comprehensive dashboards and reports to assist decision-makers.
